REQUIREMENTS
1) Tech stack (modern, easy to run locally):
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Lucide-react icons
- No database required
- Content driven by a single data file (e.g., src/data/profile.ts) so I can edit everything quickly

2) Multi-page site structure (must be real routes/pages):
- Home (/)
- About (/about)
- Projects (/projects)
- Skills (/skills)
- Certifications (/certifications)
- Contact (/contact)

3) Design requirements:
- Modern dark theme by default with a light-mode toggle
- Hero section with strong headline + short bio + call-to-action buttons (View Projects, Download CV, Contact)
- Clean layout, good spacing, responsive (mobile-first)
- Subtle gradient background + glassmorphism cards + soft shadows
- Smooth page transitions and section animations
- Include a sticky navbar with active route highlight
- Footer with social links + quick navigation

4) Content to include (use placeholders where needed, but structure everything properly):

- Machine Learning Image Classifier: Streamlit app + GitHub
- Real Estate Price Predictor: Streamlit app + GitHub
- Sentiment Analysis Tweets Web App: NLP + Streamlit app
Include external links fields (GitHub + live app) and show “Live Demo” only if a link exists.

SKILLS:
- Group skills into categories: Programming, ML/AI, Data, Deployment, Tools
- Include: Python, SQL, R, C++, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Git/GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, feature engineering, model evaluation, time-series, CV, NLP

CERTIFICATIONS:
- IBM Machine Learning Specialization
- IBM Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras & TensorFlow Specialization

(Include credential ID fields and issue dates if available; otherwise leave as placeholders)

CONTACT:
- A contact form (client-side) with validation (name, email, message)
- “Copy email” button
- Social links section
- Optional: integrate EmailJS but make it optional + documented (do not require secret keys to run)

5) Downloadable + easy local run (very important):
- Provide clear README with steps for Windows:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
  - npm run build
  - npm start
- Ensure it runs on a standard laptop (Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM) with no extra services.
- Include package.json scripts and ensure no missing imports.

6) Extras (must include):
- SEO: page titles, meta descriptions, OpenGraph tags
- A “Resume/CV” download button that points to /public/Kelvin_Kgarudi_CV.pdf (use placeholder file)
- A “Featured Projects” section on Home (top 3)
- A timeline section (education timeline)
- A testimonials section (use placeholder quotes)
- A blog/news section (optional, can be static)

DELIVERABLE
Generate the complete Next.js project with all pages, components, Tailwind config, data file, and README.
Make sure the site looks premium and is not a basic template.
